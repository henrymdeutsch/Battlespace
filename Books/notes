Tracking Hours
(just for fun, to see hourly rate at the end)
- 9/28/20: 8:20pm - 11:30pm: 3hrs 10 minutes: found bootstrap, changed design to be more in line with existing website, made viewable on phone, started to work on glitches.
    (spent all day working on Mom's HTML email)
- 9/30/20: 2.5 hours spent messing with a bootstrap that I ended up giving up because trimming it down was too complicated. Got some good ideas though. Like I think switching between chapter & questions should be done with a second nav bar that floats there.
- 9/30/20: another 2 hours 15 minutes after 9. For that entire time I was just making a completely separate doc starting completely from trash, at the very least just to learn.
- 10/5/20: probably 5 hours total. Didn't actually do anything. More just figured out that I had already solved the nav issue (scrolling off screen), and then figured out that including it as a tab in the website it too much work - better to have it fill in a new tab.
- 10/6/20: around 5 hours total. Finished the vertical nav bar and started adding the header into the mix. Ran into an issue, though.
- 10/7/20: 4 hours 20 minutes hours total. Worked on nav bar and heading for 3 hours 40 minutes. Kept thinking I was done, and then though of other things to change. Spent the rest of that time looking for bootstraps.
- 10/8/20: 6 hours total. Spent 3 hours working on getting a horizontal nav to suck on a skinny iphone, but be bearable elsewhere. 3 hours working on making the nav bar actually toggle between chapters (all on a single site).
- 10/9/20: 5.5 hours total. Spent 4.5 hours working on the style of questions (mostly spent fixing bug of text flowing around bullet) + fixed bugs in index page books section. Spent 40 minutes thinking about stuff and doing nothing, and then 20 minutes copying just the text of Ch. 1 onto the website.
- 10/10/20: 6.3 hours total. Spent 6.3 hours working on the general layout of everything. Payed around with toggle mechanics to fix a bunch of bugs on iphone, and planned out the style of chapter 1 and further chapters. Fixed a bunch of bugs.
- 10/11/20: 4 hours total. Spent 3.5 hours getting text to stay while toggling and messing around with miscellaneous things. Spent the remaining 30 minutes getting the fonts in chapters to look consistent.
- 10/13/20: 7.6 hours total. Spent around 3 of that trying to figure out why arr.splice wasn't working, and finally went on codementor. The rest was very efficient, worked solely on javascript for questions, got very far.
- 10/14/20: x hours total. Sent 5 hours getting question javascript to work. Bam. Everything I was stressing over done in 2 days (actually 13 hours but whatever).

Tomorrow
Today you got the toggle to work PERFECTLY, and in the remaining 30 minutes you got the fonts in chapters to look consistent. Light but happy day.
Tomorrow, work straight away on getting the chapters to work. Put all the questions in an array and fish them out of a hat, then re-make the array without the last one every time next is pressed. Something like that. Good luck - past Henry

To Do (super simple so far)
- use the font size and font weight in finished quiz section in the quesitons as well, to make them consistent. Lower the fonts on smaller devices to the way they are currently on the questions section.

Unnecessary, but could be done:
- Figure out how tf to get the navbar to be reactive like it was before. It's really the ProBooks image that's holding everything back. I set a width: 66px on the mainNav just to make everything consistent.
- Figure out why nav bar freaks out on iphone. Honestly, fuck that unless someone notices. I'll probably have to remake the entire structure of the site.

Files to change:
- oldQuestions.js DONE
- script.js DONE
- style.css
- questions.html DONE
- chapters.html for good measure DONE


Things I've learned:
- The power of min-width: 300 !important; - if the entire body of text is drifting to the left, surround everything in a div and give it that property. Needs to be wrapped closely around elements so there is no conflicting rule.
- To get reactive elements, it's so easy to rely solely on javascript if window.innerWidth < x, then el.style.width = this.
